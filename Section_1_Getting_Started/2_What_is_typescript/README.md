### What is TypeScript ?
- A programming Language created to address shortcomings of JavaScript
- TypeScript is build on top of JavaScript hence every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file

> #### Real World Understanding

- JavaScript is a kid without discipline
- TypeScript is a kid with discipline

> #### Benefits

- Static Typing
- Code Completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations

> #### Drawbacks

- Compilation Step
- Required Discipline in Code

> #### Transpilation Process

    TypeScript Compiler translates TypeScript code into valid JavaScript code

> #### Types of Programming Languages

**1. Statically Typed Programming Languages**
- Existing Languages - C, C++, Java
- Data type of variable is immutable once declared
    
_Understanding_
```int number = 10;```

_Valid Variable Assignment_
```number = 20;```

_Invalid Assignment_
```number = "20";```

_Benifits_
- Code will become less buggy
- Errors can be catched at the runtime
    
_Drawbacks_
- Number of lines can be increased
- More patience required

**2. Dynamically Typed Programming Languages**
- Existing Languages - JavaScript, Python
- Data type of varialbe is mutable at runtime

_Examples_
```number = 10;```

_Valid Variable Assignment_
```number = 20;```
```number = "20";```

_Benifits_
- Gives Flexibility
    
_Drawbacks_
- Code will becomes more buggy with increase in line of code.
